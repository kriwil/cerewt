Cerewt (a wordplay for cerewet, Indonesian for chatty) is a simple webapp for finding who's the most chatty person in your timeline (in certain period of time â€“ well, in your 500-ish latest home timeline).

Home timeline is the timeline you see when you log in to twitter, tweets from your friends, that is.

To use this app, you have to sign-in using your twitter account. Don't worry, there won't be any funny stupid auto-post tweet or changing your account data or other stupid stuffs.

It has some limitiations. You could only check your statistic every hour. It only fetch 500-ish tweets due to twitter limitations. It'll exponse your followings to the public, so you if don't want to people know who you follow, you shouldn't use this. Other than that, enjoy :)
