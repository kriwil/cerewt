    Built on top google app engine (python), because it's free, hurray!
    Well of course it has some limitation (not even a unique constraint in
    the model? arrggh), and only for limited resources (then you have to
    pay for more). So, please don't over-use this please, pretty please ...
    Anyway, enjoy.

    <h2>Eh? what's Cerewt?</h2>
    <p><a href='/'><em>Cerewt</em></a>
    (a wordplay for cerewet, Indonesian for <em>chatty</em>) is a simple
    webapp for finding who's the most chatty person in your timeline
    (in certain period of time &ndash; well, in your 500-ish latest
    home timeline).</p>
    <p>Home timeline is the timeline you see when you log in to twitter,
    tweets from your friends, that is.</p>
    <p>To use this app, you have to sign-in using your twitter account.
    Don't worry, there won't be any
    <strike>funny</strike> stupid auto-post tweet or changing your account
    data or other stupid stuffs.</p>
    <p>
        <a href='/connect'><img src='/media/img/sign-in-with-twitter-l.png'></a>
    </p>
    <p>It has some limitiations. You could only check your statistic
    every hour. It only fetch 500-ish tweets due to twitter limitations.
    It'll exponse your followings to the public, so you if don't want to
    people know who you follow, you shouldn't use this. Other than that,
    enjoy :)</p>
